## The foundation for a connected ecosystem

For SEEK Asia to truly be uniformed, a set of principles must exist to foster a consistent and connected experience between its multiple brands (jobsDB, JobStreet.com), on its multiple platforms (JSMY, Recruitment Centre, mass emails,) to its multiple user segments (talents, employers).

Here are the SEEK Asia design principles:

### We empathise (Research)
Seek to understand both our users and organisation. We all have pain points.

### We’re storytellers (Conceptualisation)
Entice through storytelling. It’ll let both sides envision the bigger picture.

### We clarify (Execution)
Eliminate ambiguity by consistently solving the core problem. Rinse and repeat.

### We build trust (Building relationships)
A product of doing the other principles justice. Trust is an asset, not a commodity.
