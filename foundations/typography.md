Text is important for users to digest content and accomplish their tasks. It’s important for our products to adopt good typographic principles to establish a clear visual hierarchy and to maximize legibility.

## Our brand typeface

# This is Muli

Muli is a minimalist Sans Serif typeface designed by Vernon Adams. Muli is mainly used as a display font and it is also used as a text font. Muli has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

## Usage

We use a visual loudness guide to systematically describe the typographic style. Each style has a different “volume” corresponding to its intended visual prominence. This article highlights can help you understand the volume concept a little better. https://www.viget.com/articles/visual-loudness/.

```type|smoothing, single, span: 2

  "headings": [28, 24],
